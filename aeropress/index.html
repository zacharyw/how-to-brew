title: Pour Over
---
<p>The Aerobie AeroPress is a curious coffee maker (made curiouser because its created by a frisbee company) that combines elements from the pour over, the French press, and even an espresso machine. This amalgation of techniques leads to a nuanced cup that is simpler to brew than the sum of its parts. It is one of the easiest, quickest, and cleanest methods for brewing a great cup of coffee at home.</p>

<p>
Begin the process with the rubber plunger inserted about half an inch (1.25 cm) into the end of the tube part of the press closest to the number 4. Set the press, plunger down, such that the flared, open part of the tube is facing up.</p>

<p>
Measure out 2 tablespoons of ground coffee. The grind should be more towards the finer side of the spectrum, though not as powdery as an espresso grind. </p>

<p>
Place the grinds into the press so that they are sitting on the rubber plunger.</p>

<p>
Bring 8oz of water to 200 degrees Fahrenheit (93C.)</p>

<p>
Slowly pour the water over the grounds until you have about as much water as you do grounds, then use a spoon or plastic stirer to make sure the grounds are completely saturated. Let this slurry set for 30 seconds.</p>

<p>
Pour the remaining water into the press, and let sit for 2.5 - 3 minutes.</p>

<p>
While you are waiting, warm another 6 - 8 oz. of water.</p> 

<p>
Note: Once you are experienced with the water level required for 8 oz. of coffee, you can heat the entire batch at the beginning.</p>

<p>
Insert one of the rounder paper filters into the plastic filter cap. Hold it over cup you will be using to drink your coffee, and carefully pour your new water through the filter and into the cup.</p> 

<p>
Note: Rinsing paper filters is an important for removing "papery" flavors from your coffee, and preheating your cup prevents your drink from cooling too quickly.</p>

<p>
After 2.5 - 3 minutes has passed and your coffee is ready, stir the slury 5 - 10 more times, then screw the plastic cap with paper filter on top of the press.</p>

<p>
Quickly but steadily flip the press over and place it on top of your cup. The rim of the cup should support the flared plastic edge of the press.</p>

<p>
Slowly press down on the plunger. If you find the plunger drops too quickly, your grind is too coarse. If the plunger is very difficult to press, then your grind may be too fine.</p>

<p>
Note: The pressure created when plunging is what this technique shares with espresso machines,</p>
