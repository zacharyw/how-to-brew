<p>
	Simple syrup is a sweetener primarily used for cold drinks, and is extremely easy to make.

<ol>
	<li>
		Add 1 cup of water and 1 cup of sugar to a medium sauce pan. You can increase the amount of sugar to 2 cups for a thicker syrup, or 3 for a glaze.
	</li>
	<li>
		Heat over medium-high, but not to boiling, stirring until the sugar is dissolved.
	</li>
	<li>
		Remove from heat and allow to cool. Use a mason jar or syrup bottle to store.
	</li>
</ol>

<p class="note">
	Note: The reason sugar won't dissolve in cold water is because the molecules in hot water are moving faster and are more spread out, providing more room for sugar molecules to disperse. In cold water they just fall to the bottom.
