<p>
	Drip coffee is by far the most common method used to brew coffee. The process involves loading up a machine with ground coffee and letting it spray water over the grounds. This is one of the easiest and fastest ways to make coffee, but it also gives you the least control over the brewing process. You can't control the temperature of the water or how fast it is applied to the coffee, but by following a few simple rules you can maximize the flavor in the resulting cup.

		<strong>Use freshly ground coffee.</strong> Making the leap from pre-ground coffee is the best thing you can do to improve your brew.

		<strong>Use freshly roasted coffee from a quality roaster.</strong> Most supermarket coffee will not even have a roast date on the package. It's worth the time to check if there is a local roaster in your area, or visit a locally owned caf√© to see what beans they have available. Pick something with a roast date as close to today as possible.

	<li>
		<strong>Use 1 - 2 tablespoons of coffee per six ounce cup.</strong> Using too little coffee is by far the most common mistake drip brewers make, which will result in a flavorless and weak cup.

	<li>
		<strong>Remove the carafe from the burner</strong> when the coffee is finished. Leaving a pot of fresh coffee on a hot burner for very long will result in burnt, bitter tasting coffee.
